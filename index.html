<h1> About </h1>

<p> 
    I am a PhD researcher in the VISICS group at KU Leuven under the supervision of professor Luc Van Gool. 
    My research interests are in the area of visual perception algorithms for autonomous driving, 
    including realtime instance segmentation, multi-task learning and monodepth estimation.
    I have a master in Electrical Engineering (ir.) from the KU Leuven and a master in Industrial Egineering (ing.), Electronics-ICT from the KHLim.
